# DataScience_SA-1
Basic operations in Data Manipulation process

# AIM
To perform basic method operations in the Numpy and Pandas libraries.

# Explanation
NumPy provides efficient array operations like creation, indexing, reshaping, and mathematical computations on large datasets.
Pandas offers powerful tools for data manipulation using DataFrames, enabling operations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating.

# Algorithm
STEP 1: Import necessary libraries.

STEP 2: Get the information about the data

STEP 3: Perform basic methods using the data

STEP 4: Also give definitions to the methods used

STEP 5: Save the operations performed.

# Result

Thus we have performed basic method operations in the Numpy and Pandas libraries.
